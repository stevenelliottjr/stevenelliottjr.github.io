# Time Series Forecasting Dashboard

An interactive dashboard for forecasting business metrics with multiple models and confidence intervals.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive time series forecasting system with an interactive dashboard for visualizing predictions. It supports multiple forecasting models, uncertainty quantification, and automated model selection to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Features

- Multi-model forecasting (Prophet, ARIMA, ETS, Neural Networks)
- Interactive visualization with confidence intervals
- Anomaly detection capabilities
- Seasonality decomposition
- Forecast accuracy metrics and model comparison
- Easy data import from various sources (CSV, SQL, APIs)
- Export functionality for reports

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stevenelliottjr/time-series-dashboard.git
cd time-series-dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Starting the dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Programmatic API

```python
from ts_forecaster import TimeSeriesForecaster

# Initialize with data
forecaster = TimeSeriesForecaster(df, date_column="date", target_column="value")

# Fit multiple models
forecaster.fit(models=["prophet", "arima", "ets"])

# Generate forecasts
forecast_df = forecaster.predict(horizon=30, return_components=True)

# Evaluate models
metrics = forecaster.evaluate()
best_model = forecaster.get_best_model(metric="rmse")
```

## Dashboard Preview

The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for:
- Data uploading and preprocessing
- Model selection and parameter tuning
- Interactive forecast visualizations
- Seasonality analysis
- Model performance comparison

## Demo

A live demo is available at:
[Time Series Forecasting Dashboard](https://time-series-dashboard.streamlit.app)

## Performance

The system has been evaluated on various time series datasets:

| Dataset | Best Model | MAPE | RMSE |
|---------|------------|------|------|
| Retail Sales | Prophet | 3.2% | 254.3 |
| Web Traffic | Neural Prophet | 4.5% | 125.8 |
| Energy Consumption | ARIMA | 2.8% | 45.6 |
